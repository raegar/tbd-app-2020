      Offer Note
    </h1>
    <p>
      Offers can only be made if applicant has acheived their qualifications and not if they are waiting for their grade to be published. 
      <br />
      They need to ring back once their grade has been confirmed 
    </p>
    <p>
      If applicant has declared a criminal conviction or applied with prior credit, an offer cannot be made.
      <br />
       Inform applicant we will arrange a telephone interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL verbal offers must be prefaced with the words "On the basis of the information you have provided, I am pleased to offer you a place on ..."

       • The applicant must then add UCP as their Clearing Choice via UCAS Track (ideally within 24 hours).
      <br />
       If the applicant does not have a UCAS application and they are only wishing to apply to UCP, an RPA form can be completed in place of UCAS - speak to Zoe Rumball
