        <p>
          Offers can only be made if applicant has acheived their qualifications and not if they are waiting for their grade to be published.
        </p>
        <p>
          They need to ring back once their grade has been confirmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If applicant has declared a criminal conviction or applied with prior credit, an offer cannot be made.
        </p>
        <p>
           Inform applicant we will arrange a telephone interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          ALL verbal offers must be prefaced with the words... "On the basis of the information you have provided, I am pleased to offer you a place on ..."
        </p>
        <p>
           The applicant must then add UCP as their Clearing Choice via UCAS Track (ideally within 24 hours).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the applicant does not have a UCAS application and they are only wishing to apply to UCP, an RPA form can be completed in place of UCAS - speak to Zoe Rumball
